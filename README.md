# Remote control

**This thing is a huge mess. Please don't look at it. Look at Hopper, Guppy or Hamilton instead.**

Super simple library to allows you to just import few things and get a free remote control over websockets with either touch screen or gamepad.  
No one should probably use this. It's pretty meh. I just find that I need this a lot so include them a lot

## Nipplejs license

I included the library in tree since it makes installing this library on systems without npm easy.  
License can be found in `static/nipplejs-LICENSE-MIT` and is thus accessible to both in source and to clients.
